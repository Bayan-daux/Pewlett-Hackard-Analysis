# **Pewlett Hackard Analysis**

## **Overview**

This project is a hypothetical scenario in which an HR analyst at company called Pewlett Hackard is tasked to preform employee research. PH is a large company, boasting several thousand employees and it has been around for a long time. As baby boomers begin to retire at a rapid rate, PH is looking towards the future in two ways. First, it’s offering a retirement packages for those who meet certain criteria. Second, it is starting to think about which position will need to be filled on the near future. The number of upcoming retirements will leave thousands of job openings. PH is looking ahead and starting to prepare for these many vacancies. Therefore, the HR Analyst will perform the tasked research and help the company leadership in answering the following questions:
 
1-	Who will be retiring in the next few years?

2-	How many positions will PH need to fill?

The analysis will help future proof PH by generating a list of all employees eligible for retirement package. As PH has been mainly using Excel and VBA to work with their employee data, its only available in a form of six CSV files. However, currently they decided to update their methods and build a database to house all their data using SQL.  


## The process and outcomes for this project

To build the database PostgreSQL and pgAdmin were used. Starting by modeling the data by creating entity relationship diagrams (ERDs). Then importing company’s available data (six CVS files) into the database, troubleshoot common errors, and followed by creating queries that use the employees’ data to answer the questions stated above.
